                Canora, Saskatchewan became the site of a new amateur radio
                repeater, in Saskatchewan for Amateur Radio hobbyists and a form
                of emergency communication, in November, 1997.

                Randy & Michelle Molyneaux had relocated from Unity,
                Saskatchewan to Canora, when Randy accepted a job transfer
                through his employer. While, in Unity we kept in touch with
                James Bucsis, a former friend of mine and at the time was
                located at Bonnyville, AB. and in one of his visits, he
                introduced me to Amateur Radio. He had made a contact within
                Unity&apos;s town limits with another operator using his portable HTX
                202 portable radio, and from then on, I knew I wanted to become
                an amateur radio operator. I had introduced myself to other
                operators in the area and asked how I could get my license. Soon
                both myself & my wife had both become amateur radio operators,
                in June 1995. Through a course they offered locally. Everything
                was fine and dandy, except I needed a radio to communicate to
                others. I had purchased a HTX 202 Portable for my first radio,
                and realized that with just a rubber ducky antenna, I wasn&apos;t
                able to communicate with James in Bonnyville, AB, some 3-1/2
                hours away.{" "}

              <p>
                This is when I had become interested in building antennas. One
                of my first, out of many projects was a 2 meter J-Pole
                constructed out of stainless steel tubing, after completing
                construction of the antenna, I had borrowed a SWR Meter to
                verify that the antenna had a low enough reading, not to damage
                my radio, and sure enough with it being 1.2:1 Ratio, well below
                the 1.5:1, I was able to use it. The fall of 1995, I was able to
                get in contact with neighbouring repeaters like North
                Battleford, Sonningdale, and Lloydminster. I remember staying up
                very late or very early, when conditions were good, to
                communicate with James (VE6HJB) and many other ham operators on
                the Lloydminster Repeater.
              </p>
              <p>
                My amateur radio contacts I made through talking on the radio
                and also taking part in regular hamfests, both in Saskatchewan
                and Alberta got me interested more in the hobby, and soon I had
                learned, I wanted to build my own repeater. I had scrounged up a
                20 Amp power supply, & RG8 coax from a hamfest in Alberta and
                purchased a VHF Micor mobile radio from a government surplus
                sale out of Regina. The winter of 1996, I got to know Ray Rosler
                (VE5RAE) from North Battleford; he had all the equipment and the
                knowledge to go with building a repeater. He had informed me,
                that we needed a controller, so I had saved my pennies, and
                purchased a used controller from another amateur radio operator,
                located in Lloydminster, Scott Diamond (VE5FD), now using his
                new call sign (VE6RZ). Well, that wasn&apos;t all I needed, I also
                required a frequency to legally transmit on, so I applied to the
                frequency controller for Saskatchewan and was assigned 147.080
                TX and 147.680 RX, Ray had ordered up the crystals required for
                the radio, and by the spring of 1997, I had a working repeater
                with a range of about 6 miles, using dual antennas spaced at 2
                wavelengths apart or 12 feet, with low power output was able to
                have good quality audio.

                Once, my wife & I had successfully relocated to Canora, in
                November, 1997, I had more challenges to overcome. One was lack
                of Amateur radio operators, and a second was, without amateur
                radio operators, their was no club, meaning no resources, then
                only I had realized, how important it was to have not only
                active amateur radio operators, but also their working knowledge
                that goes with making a hobby so interesting, fade. I was only
                licensed to operator with basic and advanced privileges. I had
                realized how once very active the radio waves were, it had been
                so silent. I had once again installed my 2 antenna’s that I had
                kept, one being the J-Pole and the other a 2 Meter Quad, to try
                to reach out, to one of the following repeaters: Yorkton,
                Theodore, & Wynyard. Yorkton & Theodore repeaters, I was able to
                work with almost full signal strength, but Wynyard the most
                important repeater (because the repeater was linked with other
                repeaters in Saskatchewan) to me now, was only able to work,
                when conditions were great.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had two options left: one was to get my HF license, so I would
                be able to communicate over the HF bands or to try to persist,
                with a working long range repeater on VHF, that would reach,
                more than a radius of 6 miles. I had realized our geography in
                Canora, with two Provincial parks and other resorts in the area,
                attracted many people from out of town, knowing that a working
                long range repeater, would be used if in operation, I had
                continued with my goal. I kept in touch with James (VE6HJB) and
                told him, that for the repeater to be able to work as a long
                range repeater, I would require a set of duplexers, tuned to the
                frequency of 147.080 TX & 147.680 RX and height would also be a
                great asset, if this was to work, a 30’ TV antenna tower wasn’t
                going to cut it.

              <p>
                I approached Michael Yaholnitsky of Sky Farms Ltd., and Miccar
                Aerial Applicators, to provide use of their elevator for the
                proposed site for the repeater. They had agreed to provide the
                facility for our equipment. To keep costs down, and also to keep
                signal loss to a minimum, I had agreed to house the repeater at
                the very top of the elevator’s annex at a height of 100’. The
                challenging part of all this was how in the world was I to get
                all the equipment to the top, and also keep it safe from the
                outside elements, such as rain and sun light. I had a local
                contractor construct me a container of about 24&quot;W X 30&quot;L X 36&quot;H,
                with it being insulated, I had decided to go one extra step, and
                have the container fully covered with sheet metal for the long
                term. The equipment and the container were able to be installed
                in the fall of 2000. The elevator, being a commercial building
                had to have certain codes & regulations that, I had never
                considered before, one was to hire a local contractor to install
                the wiring to operate the equipment being used. Finally,
                everything was in place and the repeater was powered up in June,
                2001, and other amateurs in the area were able to take advantage
                of the repeater, with a mobile range of 10 miles and base to
                repeater of about 25 miles.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had told James (VE6HJB) of how the repeater was working, and,
                I thought I had accomplished a lot, but still after all that, I
                knew, if I had a set of duplexers for the repeater, it would
                have a lot longer range than 10 miles mobile. James at that time
                informed me also of relocating closer to home, and James and his
                wife Linda moved to Canora in the fall of 2000. During the
                winter we inquired about a set of duplexers, that was reasonably
                priced and something not easy to find used. We were in touch
                with Peter (VE5PFL) and Gerald (VE5YZ) both of Yorkton, informed
                us that the Yorkton repeater was going to be removed from
                service, and they didn’t have the resources to construct another
                working repeater system
              </p>
              <p>
                James and I acquired a set of duplexers that was located out at
                Gerald&apos;’s farm site East of Yorkton. James arranged for the
                duplexers to be tuned by Ronald Communications in Russell,
                Manitoba, and they were hoisted up by crane to the top of the
                elevator in August of 2002. The duplexers worked great, with a
                mobile range of 20 miles or more, but we weren’t satisfied, we
                wanted more. We decided to form a club.

                Canora Amateur Radio Club was formed in the fall of 2002, and we
                sent out letters, to inform others of our club, looking to
                expand our repeater with our neighbouring amateur radio
                operators in Friendly Manitoba, we had received enough dues to
                start on the next project, and that was to have the repeater on
                full battery backup power, and to link with the rest of the
                World using the Internet Radio Linking Project (IRLP), which
                could not have been done, without the help of Bill Gade (VE4WO)
                president of the Dauphin Amateur Radio Club.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Beginning members of the Canora Amateur Radio Club were as

                This activity sparked an essence in radio communication in
                Canora, just imagine talking on a portable radio to someone
                across the country, or even, on the other side of the world with
                just a small portable radio. The Canora Amateur Radio Repeater
                enhances the emergency network that has been used in the past by
                the RCMP, Emergency Measures and Nav Canada (civil air
                navigation services), along with countless non-profit groups who
                enlisted our communications services for their events, such as
                providing security communication for the Saskatchewan
                Roughriders in Regina, and have cooperated with emergency
                workers, when their communication systems have failed, do to
                storms.
              </p>

                With further upgrades on the way and new technology of V.O.I.P.
                , EchoLink was also added to the IRLP Node in Canora, adding
                more flexibility for computer owners to connect now directly to
                our repeater, via microphone and EchoLink software on their
                personal computer. Though we could talk all over the world, we
                could not reach Melville VHF station (VE5HAW) Harvey Wirth. We
                knew if we wanted to expand our services to gain new members to
                our club, we would have to accommodate more upgrades to our
                repeater. The newly added duplexers were just not enough. We had
                purchased a new high gain antenna, from club member’s dues and
                this gave us, an excellent repeater covering even more area. You
                were now able to receive stations that were up to 35 miles away
                on their base stations, and 20 miles mobile. We thought we had
                it, but still Melville stations were unable to work the Canora
                repeater. There were three options that could accomplish this:
                1) Move the Repeater, 2) Install Link Radios, 3) provide
                Melville with another IRLP Node to establish a Link. Well, all
                options were out of the question, because we just didn’t have
                the funds available to us.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next couple of years were going to be a challenge, because
                we didn’t have the funds or enough members to fund the necessary
                upgrades to accomplish a Long Range Repeater coving 60 miles or
                more. Canora Amateur Radio Club members decided to go ahead with
                a fundraiser, to accomplish additional funding to accomplish
                further upgrades. Randy & Michelle Molyneaux designed a webpage
                for the club, with the help of Siulong Webdesign, in 2003 to add
                further information for non-members and fellow amateurs alike.
                The spring of 2005 we had over $1600.00 raised from club members
                who sold tickets, and also donations from our sponsors for the
                raffle, and other monies donated from area towns of Canora,
                Kamsack, & Preeceville have all helped to raise well over
                $2000.00 in available funding for our club. The fundraiser was
                an absolute success, which provided the means to complete the
                next phase of upgrades. We purchased the necessary equipment to
                provide another IRLP node and repeater station to be setup in
                Melville. This upgrade increased our local coverage towards the
                south to include Melville. We also had a donation from Nick Toma
                of Preeceville - a set of duplexers that was needed to operate
                the repeater on a single antenna. We have gained another club
                member Harvey Wirth (VE5HAW), where we installed the new
                Melville repeater & Node. Well, we spent most of our money for
                the above upgrades and maintenance required on both Melville and
                Canora station locations. We were enjoying the new linking
                system and communicated on a regular basis with hams locally and
                around the world, and check in regularly on the Saskatchewan 2 m
                IRLP Net on reflector 9300.

                I have stated earlier that Canora Amateur Radio Club was started

                Molyneaux (VE5RJM) and my XYL’ Michelle Molyneaux (VE5MDM) all
                from Canora. We spent many frustrating and also enjoyable days
                and evenings to establish a working group of ham operators that
                could possibly get a reliable long range repeater in full
                operation. Well, it took until Nov. 15th, 2006 to accomplish our
                initial goal we set out in 2002, when the club was first
                organized. Well, certainly we can not take all the credit,
                following our idea of forming a club; we had positive responses
                from other local ham operators which include: Peter Legebokoff
                (VE5PFL) in Yorkton, Paul Obetkoff (VE5PWO) in Kamsack, Grant
                See (VE5SS) in Preeceville, & Harvey Wirth (VE5 HAW) of
                Melville. We further investigated that by checking out Radio
                Amateur of Canada’s (RAC) website and searched the call book
                other hams were also listed in our local area, with some
                inactive and others on HF. Peter (VE5PFL) and I remembered that
                others also used the 146.880 repeater before it was
                decommissioned out of service in 2001. We have kept excellent
                record keeping books for all those who have helped the club, by
                either by equipment donation or by cash donation. Since our fist
                club meeting on April 29th, 2006 the club also acquired some new
                members which include: Grace Davies (VE5 OES), Larry Davies
                (VE5LBD) both of Gorlitz, Clarence Newstead (VE5 XU) from
                Yorkton, and Dennis Rohlick (VE5AEE) in Melville. One of the
                biggest changes to take place on the first meeting of the club
                was to rename it from Canora Amateur Radio Club (CARC) to
                Parkland Amateur Radio Club (P.A.R.C.), which was voted
                unanimously. The reason being that it no longer was the
                involvement of just Canora, but of a whole region, the Parklands
                covering East Central Saskatchewan.
              </p>
              <p>
                The year 2006 started very badly, in that the power supply had
                gone bad on our main repeater located in Canora and had to be
                replaced, which was an expense that was not expected, James
                (VE5HJB) contacted Ronald Communication, where we had purchased
                it from and even though the warranty was up, they had provided
                us with another one with no charge. Another big achievement in
                2006 was the installation of the 2nd node radio in Melville,
                located at Harvey’s (VE5HAW) residence. This no doubt was
                excellent in linking both Melville and Canora repeaters so
                everyone could “rag chew”. The remaining of the year became a
                little less involved, but we did start the “Wednesday evening
                rag chew”, which was Harvey’s idea and Harvey could also be
                heard weekdays calling the Saskatchewan 2m IRLP net.{" "}

                August of 2006, was no doubt the start of a major project, one
                in which included the participation of all club members to date,
                and also the biggest project the club has ever encountered.
                Randy (VE5RJM) was in contact with Nick Toma of Preeceville to
                tell him how the progress of the club and our achievements were
                going, when to my surprise: Nick Toma donated a commercial
                Sinclair 4 Bay SC214HD antenna, (Huge Antenna – as pictured
                below), he also donated to the club a used commercial rack mount
                110 Watt (Ex R.C.M.P.) Motorola Micor Repeater also pictured
                below. Well this started vibrating the antenna radiators…when I
                had mention it on air that same evening, I was just “well words
                just can’t describe” the amount of enthusiasm we had about this
                equipment being donated. A few days went on, we encountered a
                couple of snags…one was where could we possibly install such a
                huge antenna, and 2nd how were we going to test this new
                equipment out. It didn’t take long, and we decided to go and
                take the equipment to Prairie Mobile in Saskatoon…..because of
                the age of the repeater (they had no working knowledge either –
                how to check the equipment). A few more days went by and I
                decided to give Ray Rosler (VE5RAE) a call, since he converted
                the existing micor radio we currently were using. Before I knew
                what was going on, Larry (VE5LBD), myself (Randy (VE5RJM), Peter
                (VE5PFL) and Nick all went to see Ray with the truck full of
                equipment. Ray tested the equipment in minutes…found everything
                to be working, except the receiver could be better, so Nick also
                had his equipment along, and tested out his receiver, in another
                repeater, everything tested 110% ok. Ray explained to us that
                basically all we needed was new crystals, programmed to our
                frequency and we would have a fully functional repeater. We
                decide to leave the equipment with Ray and order up some
                crystals / channel elements for it. We called West Crystal, for
                an estimate on cost. The quote on channel elements gave us
                another surprise, because of the cost was a little more that the
                club could afford. Grant (VE5SS) heard us on one night
                discussing the channel elements what they cost, and suggested he
                would give an old friend a call. Again to our surprise, he had a
                set and had sent them to West Crystal for us, without any charge
                to the club. A few weeks went by and again the three of us went
                for a drive to see Ray, picked up the working equipment and did
                a quick install at Larry & Grace’s Residence in Gorlitz.{" "}

                The temporary setup allowed for us to adjust the squelch just
                right for use with EchoLink and IRLP nodes. This story just
                keeps on getting better and better…….you waiting for this! Peter
                was in touch with some friends of his, by the name of Frank &
                Angy Yaholnitsky of Yorkton, and of course they just happen to
                own the land, to which a 160’ Commercial Tower was standing.
                Peter (VE5PFL) mentioned what we were planning on doing, and the
                wonderful generosity of Frank & Angy Yaholnitsky; they offered
                the free usage of the tower to Parkland Amateur Radio Club. We
                could not believe it, of course Ronald Communication (owned by
                Harvey & Murray Ronald), had their equipment, in the shack, we
                asked them, and to our mystified wonder, it just happened that
                Harvey’s Brother was also, a fellow amateur radio operator, and
                gave us the green light to go ahead.{" "}

              <p>
                NOW WHAT! How in the world do we get such an antenna up to 140’
                mark…..this is no backyard antenna…..we need to think safety
                here. First of all we were going to multi couple our repeater
                with the other two on site already, but this gave me some
                concern, because with all that has happened, with all of our
                good fortune so far, we certainly did not want to cause any
                problems with others. Once again, and yes this is starting to
                sound like a ferry tale story, but this is all true. I made a
                phone call one night to an old friend, that I had just seen a
                few weeks earlier, and he was telling me about his new business
                he had started up and what he has been doing for a few years,
                and yes, you would not believe it, “He puts up commercial towers
                and equipment”. Blair Cmoc owner of HORIZON Technical Services
                installs commercial tower equipment, you can tell what I asked
                of him next. He quickly replied, “Let’s check out what you
                have”, and he already was familiar with the tower.
              </p>
              <p>
                We met on Tuesday Nov. 14th, 2006 and weather permitting he said
                we could do it tomorrow. HORIZON Technical Services donated the
                Heliax – ½” / Solid Copper Core approximately 150’. This was
                happening so fast, we could not believe it. The next day arrived
                and we were all looking to see what the weather was going to do
                for us, and by 1:00 PM we met on site, and 6:30 PM that evening,
                the repeater was in full operation. We knew others would not
                believe this story, but we have the pictures below to show it,
                and a slide show of the antenna installation. Who says Christmas

                Yorkton and Invermay, and we were just started to talk about

                very few parts that could be salvaged. Randy Molyneaux (VE5RJM)
                & Michelle Molyneaux (VE5MDM), had purchased a completely new

                Many frustrating and disheartening days followed in 2008 - 2009,
                with the Yorkton Repeater being struck by lightning, with all

                Invermay Repeater, also on a commercial tower, was also

                magnitude could happen to our club. February 18th, 2008, late
                that afternoon, a local contractor was working for the Town of
                Invermay, using heavy equipment to clean out a creek, the
                operator, came into contact with one of the guide anchors, which
                was used to keep the 220&apos; tower that was used for the operation
                of our Invermay Repeater. Randy Molyneaux (VE5RJM) received a
                call, upon arrival at the site, my wife Michelle, and I were,
                well words could not explain, seeing our tower and equipment,
                completely destroyed, along with that, the tower had landed on a

                Well, we had some hope after all, in the spring of 2008, our
                club had received an anonymous donation of a used 160&apos; guided
                DMX Tower, and once again, club members, along with Nick Toma
                arranged for the erected tower to be relocated out at Endeavour,
                Nick Toma&apos;s farm. This took several site visits to take down and
                then several more, to setup.
              </p>
              <p>
                We now had a tower, but still lacked a lot of equipment, through
                membership dues, municipal donations, and selling off some
                previously donated equipment, we were able to purchase a new
                antenna & LMR600 coax for the site. The spring of 2009 we were
                ready to install the repeater, that was previously located at
                Invermay. We were all getting very excited to see a new repeater
                site into operation, but to no avail, we once again, came into
                problems with the old equipment, and after testing it out, we
                had equipment that was in need of expensive repair, from being
                damaged.
              </p>
              <p>
                Later that summer, Grant See (VE5SS), was in contact with his
                old friend from Williams Lake BC, Dave Aitken (VE7YY) and had
                some old equipment they had in surplus, which included a
                Motorola MSR2000 Repeater. We had again depleted all of the
                clubs funds, and I, Randy Molyneaux (VE5RJM) had agreed to
                purchase the equipment and crystals, until the club could afford
                it. Fall of 2009 we were able to repair the duplexer&apos;s by
                replacing a few of the cables, and finally had a fully operation
                repeater on frequency of 147.300+ MHz. Over the winter months we
                experience poor operation at the Endeavour Site, and with
                several more visits, involving myself, Grant, Larry, & Arnold,
                we came up with the bad news, that our new antenna, we had just
                purchased, had gone bad, due to heavy ice build up.

                able to purchase another antenna, with replacement to be
                scheduled for July 2010. In the mean time we are using Nick&apos;s 4

                Parkland Amateur Radio Club (PARC), maybe chewed more than they
                can handle, with the proposed linking system, that was put on
                hold by the destruction of the Invermay site, Yorkton Fire
                Services were also in contact with us to setup an emergency
                communication system, that could be used, if and when their
                existing system failed. We decided to put a proposal forward to
                SARL our provincial organization to help us out, with some
                expenses, but were denied.{" "}

                Well, this didn&apos;t stop us from continuing with our on going
                projects, but perhaps just slowed us down a little, and in July
                of 2008, SARL, was losing their site where the Saskatoon
                Reflector was setup, and with many months of trying to find a
                new location, Randy Molyneaux (VE5RJM) was in contact with our
                club members and everybody didn&apos;t want the Reflector to be shut
                down, because it provides a special link using VOIP to link
                various repeaters across the world, which is a vital part in our
                communication network.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Randy Molyneaux (VE5RJM) was in contact with Ron Irving, Manager
                of Access Communications in Yorkton, and explained the
                situation. He had generously obliged the Parkland Amateur Radio
                Club, with the Internet Band Width required to run the reflector
                9300. We decided that Yorkton Fire Hall would be the best
                location for it, since the fire hall was near completion. SARL,
                had agreed, and had a meeting to change the name of the
                Saskatoon Reflector 9300 to the Saskatchewan Reflector 9300, and
                the reflector was temporarily put into service at Joe & Elaine
                Molyneux&apos;s residence (Randy&apos;s Parents), until March 22nd, 2010,
                when it was put in full operation, in a temporary part of the
                building of the new fire hall. SARL will be responsible for all
                expensed incurred, involving the Saskatchewan Reflector, and
                Randy (VE5RJM), has agreed to maintain the system locally.

            Long, long ago, a few curious individuals led to the growth of what
            would now be called the Parkland Amateur Radio Club (PARC). It all
            begins in 1995.

            <p>
              We are all unified in keeping Emergency Communication a main
              priority, which we want to continue even more expansion in the
              future, and to get more people involved from the area. If you are
              interested in becoming an amateur radio operator or you want to
              provide some funding assistance, you can contact any club member
              at: http://nonprofits.accesscomm.ca/parc/
            </p>
            <p>
              This project has consumed thousands of dollars and many hours of
              volunteer time, but even with that, this service could not have
              happened without the donations of other organizations for their
              understanding of the importance of having emergency communication
              service in our area. The Parkland Amateur Radio Club would like to
              thank, our sponsors, for their contribution to making this long
              term project a reality: Please take the time to check out our
              sponsors for their contributions to the club.
