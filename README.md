The Parkland Amateur Radio Club also known as PARC is a local Saskatchewan amateur radio club that has expanded to most of the south central portion in the province. There is a wide expanse of repeaters all linked together with Reflector 9300 which is managed from the club. VE5RZR, a new ham in the hobby, has taken up the role to add a new face to an old soul. For nearly 10 decades, PARC's website has appeard the same, which as a result has led to an outdated look. VE5RJM has done a fantastic job maintaining the site for its duration.
